        <section>
            <h2>What is soil pollution?</h2>
            <p>Soil pollution is the contamination of soil with harmful chemicals or substances. This can happen through a variety of ways, including industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and improper disposal of household chemicals.This invisible affliction appears when the concentration of pollutants on the surface becomes so high that it harms land biodiversity and endangers health, particularly through food. Activities such as stock breeding and intensive farming use chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers that pollute the land, just as happens with heavy metals and other natural and man-made chemical substances.
      
              Soil pollution is a global threat that is particularly serious in regions like Europe, Eurasia, Asia and North Africa, as indicated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The FAO also affirms that both intense and even moderate degradation is already affecting one third of the world's soil. Moreover, recovery is so slow that it would take 1,000 years to create a few centimetres layer of arable soil.Soil Pollution is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health hazards. 
              For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia.
              It is important to understand that all soils contain compounds that are harmful/toxic to human beings and other living organisms.
              However, the concentration of such substances in unpolluted soil is low enough that they do not pose any threat to the surrounding ecosystem.
              When the concentration of one or more such toxic substances is high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be contaminated.
      "Soil Pollution has gradually become a major challenge that we need to overcome to establish a healthy environment. Weathering of the Earthâ€™s crusts by different processes leads to the formation of soil that accumulates over the centuries. The soil is the home for a large part of bacterial biodiversity and other microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.</p>

      <p>Example of Soil Pollution:<br> <br>
      
      
      However, let us consider our very own country India. Indian economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Thus, we Indians give very high priority to the development of agriculture, fisheries, and livestock. Therefore, for surplus production, it is very important to protect crops from any type of damage that occurs due to insects, weeds, rodents, and other crop diseases.
      
      So, how do we protect crops? The self-evident answer is pesticides and herbicides. However, do you know these pesticides and herbicides are a leading cause of soil pollution? Therefore, it is very important to use pesticides because they contain lots of different harmful chemicals. Therefore, to improve soil and prevent soil pollution it is important to limit the use of pesticides and herbicides.</p>
